It works OK all by itself, but works best with the Earthdawn (FASA Official) character sheet companion script (The one script works with both the Earthdawn and 1879 character sheets).\n\nFor more information please see [Earthdawn Sheet wiki page](https://wiki.roll20.net/Earthdawn_-_FASA_Official)."
